This repository contains the **ProVerif formal verification code** for the following paper:

> **"A Secure and Efficient Authentication Scheme for Smart Grid Environments Using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) and Hash-Based Tokens"**

## üß™ Description

The ProVerif model verifies the security properties of the proposed lightweight mutual authentication and key establishment protocol designed for smart grid environments. The protocol leverages:

- Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device-level uniqueness
- Fuzzy extractors for PUF noise tolerance
- Hash-based tokens for secure communication and session key generation

The code analyzes **mutual authentication**, **secrecy of session keys**, and **resistance to replay and impersonation attacks** using ProVerif's automated symbolic analysis.
